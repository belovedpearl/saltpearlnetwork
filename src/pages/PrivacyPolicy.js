// How do we collect your information?
// We may collect information about you directly whenever you interact with us. For example, when you contact Save the Children regarding our activities, register as a supporter, send or receive information, engage with our social media or make a donation to us, you may provide us with your personal information.

// We may use your information in a number of ways, including:

// To provide you with information, products or services that you have requested from us or that we feel may be of interest to you;
// To provide you with information about our work or our activities;
// To invite you to participate in interactive features on our website;
// To process donations we may receive from you;
// To fundraise in accordance with our internal policies and procedures;
// For administrative purposes (for example, we may contact you regarding an event for which you have registered, to provide information requested from us through Supporter Care or with a query regarding a donation you may have made to us);
// For internal record keeping relating to any donations, feedback, or complaints;
// To invite you to participate in voluntary surveys or research;
// To contact you where you have been identified as a contact person for an organisation, such as a school (if we obtain your contact details in this way, we will only use them to contact you in your capacity as a representative of that organisation unless you have separately indicated that you are happy to be contacted as an individual supporter);
// To analyse and improve the content and operation of our website;
// To analyse and improve our internal business processes;
// To analyse the personal information we collect about you and use publicly available information to better understand your interests, preferences and level of potential donations so that we can contact you in the most appropriate way and to ensure that we do not send you unwanted communications;
// To tailor advertising that is presented to you on the Internet according to your interests, preferences and other characteristics (as described below);
// To direct advertisements and other communications to other people who may have similar interests or other characteristics to yours (as described below);
// To assess your personal information for the purposes of credit risk reduction or fraud prevention; and
// Where we are required by law to disclose or otherwise use your information.
// In particular, we may contact you for marketing purposes by email or text message if you have agreed to be contacted in this manner.  We may also send you service communications via email or text, for example where you place an order for goods or services on our website, or you have made a donation by text.

// If you have provided us with your postal address or telephone number, we may send you information about our work or other communications of the kinds described above by direct mail or contact you by telephone unless you have told us that you would prefer not to hear from us in this way.  We provide information about how you can change your marketing preferences below.

// How will we combine and analyse the information we collect about you?
// In our Supporter Promise, we have committed to communicating with you using an approach that is right for you. This means that we carefully manage the communications we send you to ensure that we are contacting you in the most appropriate way and that we are not sending you unwanted communications.  In order to do this, we may combine the information that we collect about you and analyse what we know about your interests, preferences and level of potential engagement or donation. We may also use statistical analysis to analyse this data and understand the likelihood that you will be interested in or responsive to a campaign or message. We may use third party service providers to assist us in this process.  For more information on how we work with service providers, please see ‘How will we disclose the information we have collected to outside parties?’.

// Where we have identified that you have the capacity or affinity to support Save the Children at a higher level, we may collect additional information about you (see ‘What information do we collect?’) and combine and analyse that information in a profile of you that will assist us in engaging with you in a more personalised way.

// You can opt out of your data being combined and analysed for marketing purposes by contacting our Supporter Care Team or our Data Protection Officer as described below. However, this may mean that you stop receiving marketing communications from us more generally, as we will be unable to determine their relevance to you.

// In accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations and our internal policies and procedures, we may also use personal information to carry out due diligence on potential or actual donors.  If you opt out of analysis of your data for due diligence purposes, we may not be able to accept donations from you. 

// How will we disclose the information we have collected to outside parties?
// Save the Children may provide your information to our service providers. Subject to your communication preferences and our internal policies and procedures, this would include providing your information to third parties that work with us to deliver on our charitable purposes, and other entities that act as fundraisers for Save the Children, sell Save the Children products or provide Save the Children with marketing information and services.

// Where you have agreed to receive email or SMS marketing communications from us, we may provide your email address or mobile phone number in an encrypted format to social media companies, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or YouTube, or to digital advertising networks that are providing services to us by displaying our advertising to you on those social media platforms and other websites, as well as identifying audiences with interests similar to yours. You can opt out of your data being used to display advertising to you by contacting our Supporter Care Team or our Data Protection Officer as described below.  However, this will not prevent our advertisements being shown to you on a randomised basis or based on cookie data and may mean that you stop receiving marketing communications from us more generally.

// We enter into contracts with all of these service providers that require them to comply with data protection laws and to ensure that they have appropriate controls in place to protect the security of your information.

// We will never sell your details.   We will only share your details with third parties (who are not service providers working at our direction) as indicated in this Policy or if you have consented or we have another legal basis to do so.  We will not make cold telephone calls to members of the general public for individual support and, therefore, will not purchase your data in order to do so.

// We may disclose your personal information if we are requested or required to do so by a regulator or law enforcement or in order to enforce or apply our rights (including in relation to our website or other applicable terms and conditions) or to protect Save the Children, for example in cases of suspected fraud or defamation, or in order to comply with any other applicable legal obligation.

// How do we protect your personal information?
// We take appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to ensure that we keep your information secure, accurate and up to date, and that we only keep it as long as is reasonable and necessary.

// Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your personal information, the transmission of information over the internet is never completely secure. We do our best to protect personal information, but we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to our website, so any transmission is at the user’s own risk. However, any payment card details (such as credit or debit cards) we receive on our website are passed securely to our payment processing provider according to the Payment Card Industry Security Standards.

// For financial and technical reasons, we may, on occasion, need to use the services of a service provider outside the European Economic Area (EEA) – this may include a country which does not have the same level of data protection as in the United Kingdom.  However, unless they are located in a country which has been assessed by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection for personal data, we will only use a service provider outside the EEA on the basis of an agreement with the service provider, designed to protect your data, in the appropriate form approved for this purpose by the European Commission – please contact our Data Protection Officer if you would like to see a copy of any of these agreements.  We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is processed securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

// How long do we keep your personal information? 
// We will keep and delete your information according to our internal policies and will keep it no longer than reasonably necessary for the purposes for which we hold it, taking into account relevant legal and regulatory retention requirements (e.g. tax or health and safety requirements) and operational considerations.

// How can you change your marketing preferences or update the information we hold about you?
// In our Supporter Promise, we pledge to make it clear and easy for you to choose how you hear from us. If you do not wish us to use your personal data for marketing purposes as outlined above, you can use the relevant box on the print or online form on which we collect your data or you can follow instructions provided in a print or poster advertisement or in a TV advert to indicate your preference.

// You can also change any of your marketing preferences at any time (including telling us that you don’t want us to contact you for marketing purposes) by:



// Contacting your Save the Children contact person;
// Entering your details on the Fundraising Preference Service (FPS) website and choosing ‘Save the Children’ (Charity Number 213890).  This service is run by the Fundraising Regulator and allows you to stop email, telephone, addressed post, and/or text messages from a selected charity or charities by using the online service at www.fundraisingpreference.org.uk or by calling the telephone helpline on 0300 303 3517.  Once you have made a request through through the FPS, we will ensure that your new preferences take effect within 28 days of your request.  More information about the FPS can be found here.
// If you have indicated that you do not wish to be contacted for marketing purposes, we will maintain your details on a suppression list to help ensure that we do not continue to contact you for marketing purposes.  However, we may still need to contact you for administrative purposes, including (but not limited to):

// Processing a donation you have made and any related Gift Aid;
// Providing you with the information you need to participate in an activity or event for which you have registered (e.g., a marathon or Christmas Jumper Day); and
// Explaining and apologising where we have made a mistake.
// Similarly, if your contact details have changed or you think any information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can always update or correct the information we hold about you by contacting us through our Supporter Care team as explained above.

// What other data protection rights do you have?
// Under UK data protection law, you have certain rights over personal information that we hold about you. These rights are summarised below. Please note that exceptions apply to a number of these rights, and not all rights will be applicable in all circumstances.

// You can assert your rights, raise a concern, or make a complaint about how we process your personal data by contacting our Data Protection Officer or our Supporter Care team.  It will assist us, if you explain your request or concern and describe the personal information you are referencing as specifically as possible. In order to action your request, we may need to request further information or request that you provide proof of identity.

// Your rights in relation to our processing of your personal information, include:

// Right to object to the processing of your data - you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.  If you object, please explain your objection and the reason for it.  If you are objecting to the processing of your data for direct marketing purposes, you can tell us in any of the ways described in the section ‘How can you change your marketing preferences or update the information we hold about you?’ above and we will stop processing your data for those purposes as soon as reasonably possible.
// Right to have inaccurate or incomplete personal information corrected or completed - if you believe our records of your personal information are inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to correct or complete those records. You can do this as described in this section or in the section ‘How can you change your marketing preferences or update the information we hold about you?’ above.
// Right to restrict processing – in certain circumstances, you have the right to ask us to stop making active use of the personal information that we retain in our records about you, if there is disagreement about its accuracy or legitimate usage.   
// Right of erasure - in certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we delete your personal information from our records.
// Right of access - you can write to us to ask for confirmation of what information we hold relating to you and to request a copy of that information. Provided we are satisfied that you are entitled to see the information requested and we have successfully confirmed your identity, we will provide you with your personal information subject to any exceptions that apply.
// Right to receive your personal information in a portable format – in limited circumstances, where we are processing information you provided to us because you gave us your consent or because it is necessary for the performance of a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means, you may ask us to provide it to you in a portable format.
// If you are not happy with how we have handled your request or complaint, you can contact the Office of the Information Commissioner, which oversees the protection of personal data in the UK.

// Alternatively, you may choose to contact the Information Commissioner directly about your complaint, regardless of whether you have raised it with us first. 

// Why are we allowed to process your personal information? 
// Our Privacy and Cookie Policies take into account several laws, including:

// the Data Protection Act 2018
// the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003
// General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679
// Generally, our processing of your personal information as described in this policy is allowed by these laws based on one or more lawful grounds, including:

// Where you have provided your consent to us using your personal information in a certain way.  For example, we only use your information to send you marketing communications by email or text with your consent.  We also may ask for your explicit consent if you share sensitive personal information with us.
// Where the processing is reasonably necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract.  For example, we may rely on this basis where you apply to work for us.
// Where the processing is reasonably necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject.  For example, we may rely on this basis where we are obliged to share your personal information with a regulator or HMRC.
// Where the processing is reasonably necessary for the purpose of a legitimate interest pursued by us or a third party and your privacy rights do not override the legitimate interest.  Our “legitimate interests” include pursuing the aims and ideals of Save the Children through advocating and campaigning for the welfare of children, supporting children and families through our work in the UK and globally, and fundraising through direct marketing campaigns, emergency appeals, special events and our retail shops.  However, "legitimate interests" can also include your interests, such as when you have requested information from us, and those of third parties, such as our beneficiaries.
// For example, we rely on legitimate interests for activities such as sending marketing communications by post or telephone unless you have told us that you would prefer not to hear from us in this way, contacting you as a representative of an organisation about charity partnerships or in order to organise an event, and analysing your interaction with us to improve our internal business processes.

// In any event, where we are relying on legitimate interests to process your personal information, we will consider any potential impact on you (positive or negative), your rights under data protection laws, and will not use your personal information for activities where the impact on you overrides the legitimate interests in the processing.

// Where we process sensitive personal data (as mentioned above), we will make sure that we only do so in accordance with one of the additional lawful grounds for processing that type of data, such as where we have your explicit consent or you have made that information manifestly public.

// Job and volunteer applicants and current and former employees
// This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information that we collect from you if you apply for a job or volunteering opportunity with Save the Children or become an employee or volunteer. 

// You will receive a separate Privacy Statement from us when providing information for these purposes.

// Your credit or debit card information
// If you use your credit or debit card to donate to us, buy something or make a booking online, we pass your card details securely to our payment processing partner as part of the payment process. We do this in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Security Standard (PDF download), and don’t store the details on our website or databases.

// Children's data
// When you register with us, you are stating that you are 18 years of age or over. You agree that any information you provide to us about yourself upon registration or at any time is true. See Terms and Conditions for more information.

// Other websites
// We cannot be held responsible for the privacy of data collected by websites not owned or managed by Save the Children, including those linked through our website.

// Emails terms of use
// Emails aren’t always secure, and they may be intercepted or changed after they’ve been sent. Save the Children doesn’t accept liability if this happens. The contents of emails reflect their author's views and not necessarily those of Save the Children.

// Please do not send Save the Children any financial data through email.

// The information in emails is confidential, so if you’ve received one by mistake, please delete it without copying, using, or telling anyone about its contents.

// Cookie Policy
// Cookies and how we use them
// What are cookies?
// Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or internet-enabled device whenever you visit us online. Cookies allow us to remember and track your device but do not provide us with anything personally identifiable such as your email address or your phone number.

// Your cookie preferences
// You can manage your cookie preferences when you visit our site by accepting all cookies, or clicking on cookie settings to select what (if any) cookies you would like to enable via our Cookie Consent Platform. If you want to change your cookie preferences later, you can click the Cookies link at the bottom of our webpage to turn different types of cookies on and off.

// You can also choose whether or not to accept cookies via your browser’s settings (often found in your browser’s Tools or Preferences menu). You may also delete cookies from your device at any time. Please be aware that if you turn off or delete certain cookies, you may not be able to fully experience some of our website’s features and there may be issues delivering the experience we would like to.

// We will store your cookie preferences for 90 days. If you return to our website at any point during this time, your preferences will be restarted from that point and last for another 90 days.

// We have included a guide on how to disable cookies in your browser at the end of this policy.

// Types of cookies
// First and third party cookies
// First party cookies are cookies that are served directly by the website operator (Save the Children UK) to your device. They are often used to recognise your device when it revisits that site, and to remember your preferences as you browse the site.

// Third party cookies are served by a service provider on behalf of the website operator, and can be used by the service provider to recognise your device when you visit other websites. Third-party cookies are commonly used for web site analytics or advertising purposes. You can find out more about the third party cookies that we use in the Categories of Cookies We Use information below.

// Session cookies and persistent cookies
// Cookies may be either 'session cookies' or 'persistent cookies'. Your device automatically removes session cookies once you close your browser. Persistent cookies will survive on your device until an expiry date specified in the cookie itself, is reached (or they are cleared). We use both session and persistent cookies.

// Categories of cookies we use
// Strictly necessary cookies:
// These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.

// Personalisation cookies:
// These cookies enable us to personalise website content to be more specific to you. They do not store details like your name or email address, but can track the website pages you visit and the forms you complete. You can refuse these cookies but the website content will be less tailored to you

// Performance cookies:
// These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site and our fundraising. They also help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. These cookies typically collect unique reference numbers that identify your browser, internet device or the actions you take on our website. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not be able to monitor the performance of our website and fundraising

// Functional cookies:
// These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages, such as using our interactive map to see how we help children worldwide. These cookies do not store information that would allow us to identify you. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.

// Targeting cookies:
// These cookies may be set through our site by us or our advertising partners. They may be used to build a profile of your interests, show you relevant adverts on other sites and to enable us to be much more efficient with the marketing we need to do to raise the funds we need. They do not store details about you, such as name or contact details, but are based on unique reference numbers that identify your browser, internet device, or your record in our systems. If you do not allow these cookies, you will still see advertising, including from possibly Save the Children, but the advertising will be less tailored to you.

// Social media cookies:
// These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.

// Use of other tracking technologies
// Although not through cookies (the small text files from above),we do use other tracking technologies like web beacons and advertising pixels (including the Meta Pixel).More information on them can be found here - https://www.cookiepro.com/knowledge/tracking-pixel/

// For example, another way we use marketing technologies is to measure the success of the emails we send – so we know what subject lines and stories people liked the most.. Additionally, we measure the success of emails to determine which email addresses are no longer in use. To enable this, we track whether an email is: successfully delivered, opened, and interacted with (e.g. link click-throughs). We do not share this information with third parties.

// What information do we collect on our website?
// We may collect some, or all, of the following information available when you visit our website. If you visit our website, we may use cookies or other tracking technologies to record information about:

// the areas of the website you visit;
// the amount of time you spend on the site;
// whether you are new to the site, or have visited it before;
// where you have visited it before, if we hold your data in another place
// the country, region, city and/or borough associated with your IP address or device;
// how you came to our website – for example, through an email link or a search engine;
// the type of device and browser you use;
// what you do on our website (i.e if you donate, sign a petition or download a file
// how you interact with our donation and sign up forms – for example what you select as your communication preferences; and
// any error messages that you receive on the site
// We also use cookies and other tracking technologies to track how visitors come to our site. For example, we use marketing or referring tracking codes in internet urls to show us whether a visitor has come to our site via a link on a referring website or in a specific piece of marketing and to give us insight into the effectiveness of our marketing. Some of this information may be used by third party cookies to target you with relevant advertising.

// Analytics
// Save the Children uses web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics. To provide website visitors with more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google have developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)
// The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to the website itself or to other web analytics services. More information about how Google Analytics is used by Save the Children can be found here: https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html

// Adobe also provides a range of opt-out options for Adobe Analytics. (https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/opt_out.html)

// We also use Medallia DXA, another web analytics service, to provide better content and service. This uses cookies to help the website analyse how users use the site to help ensure a better, smoother user experience. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Medallia in the UK. Medallia may record mouse actions and scrolling movement, as well as basic interactions with website forms, but does not track your browsing habits across other third-party websites. Medallia may transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on their behalf.
